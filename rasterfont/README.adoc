# Raster Font Example

This is a simple font bitmap font loader.

With this code you can load fonts stored in pngs and change it's color.

Keep in mind this changes each pixel color. So it may not be performant in huge images.
This was needed because the font used has two colors. You probably don't need to do this if you use the https://domeengine.com/modules/graphics#font[`transform(parameterMap)`] with the "MONO" color mode (assuming the font is always a single color), which might ease the load a bit.
