# DOME Examples

Examples made with the https://domeengine.com[DOME engine]

Make sure DOME is installed, then you can point it at each example directory.

Each example is licensed independently. Please abide by the terms of each example's license.

## Installation

Some examples use https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule[Git Submodules]. Git doesn't actually pull the submodules immediately, so you need to enter the right commands to make that happen.

```sh
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

## Jams

A Jam is an opportunity to build games with DOME, the comfortable framework for making games. It allows you to make cross-platform 2D games (for Windows, Mac and Linux) with ease.

It's a time to learn the https://wren.io[Wren programming language], leave the nest and make cute, cosy and cool games!

### Rules
- You have about 10 days to make your game so that you have time to learn Wren and the DOME APIs.
- Your entry must use DOME.
- The entry must be considered "safe-for-work".
- Assets (images, music, text, code) must be your own, or open-licensed.
- Your final game must be open-sourced.
- Have fun!
